# SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit Documentation

This repository documents the **SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit** with a practical, project-based approach. The goal is to provide a clear, structured, and reusable reference for consultants and technical teams performing system-based data migration from **SAP ERP to SAP S/4HANA** using the Migration Cockpit.

The documentation is intentionally concise and action-oriented, focusing on *what to do*, *why it matters*, and *where to find the details*.

## What is SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit?

The **Migration Cockpit** is the standard SAP tool for migrating data into SAP S/4HANA. It supports guided, object-based data migration and offers two main approaches:

* **Migrate Data Directly from SAP System** (system-based, RFC-driven)
* **Migrate Data Using Staging Tables / Files**

In this repository, the focus is on **direct system-based migration** (SAP ERP → SAP S/4HANA), covering project setup, data selection, migration object handling, and execution.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is divided into logical segments that align with the lifecycle of a Migration Cockpit project.
